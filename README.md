Image Compression using Quad Tree Format using Java


Image Compression – A Brief Look
Image compression is a type of data compression which is applied to digital images.
It is used to reduce the cost for storage and of transmission of the image. 
Algorithms usually take advantage of visual perception and the statistical properties of image 
data to provide superior results compared with generic data compression methods which are 
used for other digital data.

Our Project: Image Compressing using a Quad Tree Format
The Main Objective of our project is to build an image compression algorithm which can be 
used to compress images in any format and to any scale of compression.
Our Code is fully functional and can achieve compression without much loss in detail.

Our Reasons for choosing this Topic
We wished to implement this to 
i) Understand the working and the concepts behind Image Compression which we use on 
a regular basis.
ii)To develop an easier to implement algorithm for Image Compression.
iii) we found that this topic will enable us to illustrate our understanding in a varied 
number of concepts we have learnt and build on them.

Photo Compressor is the technical process of reducing the file size of an image document 
[without compromising on its quality]. This makes the digital photo to retain its looks and 
physical characteristics, but with a much smaller size so that it fills less space and becomes 
acceptable when uploading on relevant sites.
The reduction in file size allows you to store the image more economically and efficiently, as 
the memory space it'll occupy will now be significantly less while the time and bandwidth 
required for uploading and downloading the image will also be at the barest minimum.

This project allows the user to compress any image of any format. Depending on the image 
complexity, the compression rate changes. Our project allows effective image compression 
by implementing quadtree structure. Note that the compression can take upto O(log n) time 
complexity depending on the complexity of the image.
Future scope:
• Image decompression algorithm can be written.
• Videos can be compressed by splitting them into frames.
• GUI can be implemented to improve user accessibility.
